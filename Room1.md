- Interest of content - **Good**

A lot of the articles themselves are actually interesting, but the page itself is lacking content, as the majority of it just links to other sources.

- Consistency and quality of visual presentation - **Good**

The visual design on the first two pages (the index and the medical pages) is great, but there is not much consistency - compare the medical page and the social media page, for example.

- Quality of written presentation - **Sound**

- Validity of HTML - **Very Good**

 - Evidence of collaboration **Excellent**
 Parts of it was done at the last minute (albeit just fixes) and it looks like varying levels of effort went into the pages
